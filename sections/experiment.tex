\subsubsection*{Strict TopN Approach with Naive Adding}

In this experiment, we will use the most naive way to construct sentence embedding but try to see which N and which similarity is better. (Table~\ref{tab:different_similarity})

\subsubsection*{Different TopN Approach with Different Sentence Embedding}

In this experiment, we test the combination of strict or generalized top N and using which sentence embedding. And shows the best result of each setting. (Table~\ref{tab:different_sentence_embedding})

\subsubsection*{Best Result}

Following will list the best result among our models and the best model in the 2013 competition. (Table~\ref{tab:best_result})
