\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In our own designed approach, we found that the model “Strict Top 2 with fastText embedding and using Cosine similarity and form the sentence embedding with Naive Adding Normalized with sentence length” will generate the best result.

We think that because, in 2013, the embedding technique is not so mature. So we have taken advantage of the embedding, and thus the result beats all the best model in 2013.
